## HackBot :
    
 This bot is all about getting the interesting news from the hackernews and posting it to your twitter account every 12 hours. Using this bot I  searched the "github repository" related news on hackernews and post it on twitter. The current program will run every 12 hours posting a tweet on my account.
 
  To start with this application you will need the basic python knowledge.
   
  Before starting the development of the this application you will need to create a demo application using your [twitter developer account](https://apps.twitter.com/).
   
   Fill up all the details required by twitter to create the demo application. After creating the demo application you will be provided with different keys and the tokens.
       
   Keep these things handy:
   - Consumer Key (API Key)
   - Consumer Secret (API Secret)
   - Access Token
   - Access Token Secret
   
   All the keys mentioned above will be used to access the twitter api. Create your own workspace and install the python libraries mentioned below. 
   
   - [install tweepy](http://www.tweepy.org/)
   - [install haxor](https://github.com/avinassh/haxor) 
   
   ##Code 
   
   ######  Below method uses the in-built functions from the haxor lib to invoke the HackerNews() api. You can find more info at the haxor link mentioned above. During the program first "for loop" extract the story ids (top 100 stories) and  add it to the list,  using these story ids we extract the required data to be used.

          def getNews():
        
            hn = HackerNews()
            story_id=[]
            items_list=[]
        
        
            #add the stories ids
            for stories in hn.top_stories(limit=100):
                story_id.append(stories)
        
        
            #get the ids and exrtact the useful information out of it
            for ids in story_id:
                items_list.append(hn.get_item(ids))
        
        
            return items_list      
           
   ######  Below code uses the different keys and tokens to establish a secure access with the twitter API. Once you get the access you can invoke different actions based on the API.
   
        import tweepy
        import ExtractHackerNews
        import time
        
        consumer_key ='XXXXXXXXX'
        consumer_secret='XXXXXXXXX'
        access_token='XXXXXXXXX'
        access_token_secret='XXXXXXXXX'
        auth = tweepy.OAuthHandler(consumer_key, consumer_secret)
        auth.set_access_token(access_token, access_token_secret)
        
   
        
        api = tweepy.API(auth)
   
   
   
   ######  Below section fetches  different stories from  hackernews. It will pick the stories containing the "github" keyword in the url and post it to twitter account using  api.update_status(). You will be able to see post from the hackernews updated to twitter. 
   
   ######  This code has the sleep time of 12 hours. After every 12 hours you will find a new post on your twitter personal page.
        news=[]
        status=''
        url_link=''
        
        
        
        
        while True:
            for res in ExtractHackerNews.getNews():
        
                if res.url is not None:
                    if "github" in res.url.lower():
                        status = res.title
                        url_link = res.url
                        break
        
        
        
            api.update_status(status=status+'\n'+'- feed from HackerNews'+'\n'+url_link)
        
        
            print 'tweet successfully posted'
            
            time.sleep(12*60*60)
