## HackBot :
    
   This bot is all about getting the interesting news from the hackernews and posting it to your twitter account every 12 hours. Using this bot I have searched the github repository related news on hackernews and posted it on twitter. The current program will run every 12 hours posting a tweet on my account.
   Before starting the development of the this application you will need to create a demo application using your [twitter developer account](https://apps.twitter.com/).
   Creating an demo application after filling up all the details you will need the different credential to access the twitter API. 
   
   Keep these things handy:
   - Consumer Key (API Key)
   - Consumer Secret (API Secret)
   - Access Token
   - Access Token Secret
   
   All the keys will be used to access the twitter api. Create your workspace and install the python libraries.
