## About Me:

I am computer science master student. Did'nt even had the personal computer till the age of 20, but that didnt stopped me from learning new things. Currently I am in constant hunt of new new opportunities that will take me step forward. Currently working as Software developer at Vantage Labs, PA, USA.

Here are few links that will tell you about my past, current and future:

## Summary:

I will discuss few things in this blog to get you started. First thing to keep in mind is that there are no shortcuts, and no one is born talented. You have to practice a lot to get the hang of programming and understand concepts related to the data structure and algorithm. 



###  Chapter 1: Try to keep it simple : 
  	
   Learn only one programming language completely. Once you understand how the programming concepts works its easy to use other language according to your need. You don't waste your time thinking about programming language. You may learn Java, Ruby, Python, Scala, Javascript whichever you find it useful. To keep things simple I would recommed start with Java grasp the programming concepts quickly and move on to some coding problems. Doing so will increase your confidence over the language and help you gain the practical coding experience.
  	
   Always remember it is not at all diffcult to learn the programming language. Think it this way, you are doing automation of things that would otherwise you will not be able to do manually or you are bored of doing it manually. Always try to think how you can automate the things with higher performance. This thinking will let you have higher level idea then you split it with objects and methods and start coding for it.
  	
  Take away : Start learning one language. Grap the concepts. Practice online coding.
  	
###   Chapter 2 : Believe in yourself :
  	
  It looks cool to be developer because it is represented to you that way. But when you start to get your hands dirty you understand its seriousness. Its the idea which you are developing makes coding interesting and keep pushing you forward. This means dont bother about how hard the programming language is to learn, keep practicing one coding question in day. There are many sites which provides the online coding challenge in different areas. Hackerrank, Leetcode, Topcoder are the best ones you can try it yourself. Many people will tell you about different programming languages in the market, dont get distracted it all based on the same set of principles with some tweaks. So focus on what you are learning, it will take you to realize that what you are doing is great.

  I would recommend you start with basics :
